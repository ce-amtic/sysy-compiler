### Quick Start

Put your source code in `out/test.c`.

```
make
make output
make test
```

Use `make plot` to generate Abstract Syntax Tree for your source code. `plot/tree.py` is a helpful script that generates an AST using a production reduction stream.

Use `test.sh` to automatically run tests.
